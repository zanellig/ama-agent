Reference guide for creating visually effective designs. Use these principles as a checklist when generating frontend interfaces.

## 1. Alignment

**What it is:** The arrangement of text and elements to create order and visual connection by aligning to a common edge, center, or baseline.

**Why it matters:** Enhances readability and guides viewers' eyes through content in a digestible way.

**How to apply:**
- Use a layout grid to organize elements
- Align text left for left-to-right languages
- Use consistent alignment throughout sections
- Apply auto layout for precise spacing

---

## 2. Contrast

**What it is:** Creating noticeable difference between elements to add visual interest and emphasize important information.

**Why it matters:** The human eye naturally gravitates toward elements with higher contrast.

**Ways to create contrast:**
- Color (e.g., red against white background)
- Size (large vs. small elements)
- Weight (bold vs. light typography)
- Texture and shapes
- Alignment differences

**How to apply:**
- Focus on the most important details and use higher contrast to make them stand out
- Use contrast for calls-to-action
- Avoid applying too much contrast (creates visual jarring)

---

## 3. Balance

**What it is:** Distributing the visual weight of design elements to create a cohesive design.

### Symmetrical Balance
- Even distribution of visual weight
- Creates harmony within a design
- Elements on each side have equal weight
- Best for: formal, stable, trustworthy aesthetics

### Asymmetrical Balance
- Uses asymmetry for dynamic compositions
- Elements of different weight balance each other
- Creates visual excitement and energy
- Best for: modern, creative, bold aesthetics

**How to apply:**
- Use grid lines to position elements
- Strategically use white space to prevent clutter
- Balance heavy elements with lighter ones

---

## 4. Hierarchy

**What it is:** Strategically arranging and emphasizing elements in order of importance to direct viewers to the most important information first.

**Example:** A social media ad might feature:
1. Photo of product (focal point)
2. Bold headline at top (primary message)
3. Address/contact info at bottom in smaller font (secondary info)

**How to apply:**
- Place most important information at the top
- Use size to indicate importance (larger = more important)
- Use colors and bold fonts to emphasize crucial details
- Create clear visual paths through content

---

## 5. Color

**What it is:** Strategic use of color to evoke emotions, communicate messages, and shape brand perception.

### Color Theory
How colors work together based on the color wheel:
- **Complementary:** Opposite colors (blue & orange)
- **Analogous:** Adjacent colors
- **Triadic:** Three evenly spaced colors

### Color Psychology
How colors influence behavior and emotions:
- **Yellow:** Elevates mood, energy
- **Blue:** Calmness, trust
- **Red:** Urgency, passion
- **Green:** Growth, nature
- **Black:** Sophistication, luxury

**How to apply:**
- Choose colors that align with brand identity
- Consider accessibility for color vision deficiencies
- Use color consistently across the design
- Limit palette to 3-5 colors for cohesion

---

## 6. White Space (Negative Space)

**What it is:** The empty area between and around text and design elements.

**Why it matters:**
- Gives design breathing room
- Creates balance
- Improves readability
- Prevents cluttered feeling
- Emphasizes important details
- Guides the user's eye

**How to apply:**
- Consider purpose: minimal designs need more white space
- Use consistent padding and margins
- Don't fear empty space—it's a design element
- Use white space to separate sections

---

## 7. Proportion

**What it is:** The size and weight of design elements in relation to one another.

**Why it matters:**
- Creates visually pleasing balance
- Establishes visual hierarchy (large = important)
- Creates harmonious compositions

**Example:** The North Face logo uses a bold but readable font that complements the half-dome icon without overpowering it.

**How to apply:**
- Use grid system for consistent proportions
- Balance heavier-weighted objects with lighter ones
- Consider visual weight, not just physical size
- Exaggerate proportions intentionally for emphasis or humor

---

## 8. Repetition

**What it is:** Reusing identical or similar elements throughout designs.

**What to repeat:**
- Colors
- Textures
- Shapes and patterns
- Fonts and typography styles
- Spacing rhythms

**Why it matters:**
- Creates cohesion and balance
- Establishes visual rhythm
- Strengthens brand recognition
- Guides viewers seamlessly through design

**How to apply:**
- Create a design system for consistency
- Use consistent button styles, card designs, spacing
- Repeat brand colors and fonts throughout

---

## 9. Rhythm

**What it is:** Creating a sense of movement, flow, and visual interest through the placement and spacing of repeated elements.

### Four Types of Rhythm

| Type | Description | Visual Pattern |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Regular** | Same clear pattern, consistent spacing | ● ● ● ● ● |
| **Random** | No distinct pattern, elements placed randomly | ● ◆ ■ ● ◆ |
| **Flowing** | Curved patterns using lines and organic shapes | ～～～～ |
| **Progressive** | Subtle change in each element showing gradual progression | ○ ◐ ● |

**How to apply:**
- Choose rhythm type that aligns with design style
- Use grid for regular, structured rhythm
- Use curves and fluid shapes for flowing rhythm
- Create progression through size, color, or opacity changes

---

## 10. Movement

**What it is:** The way a user's eye is guided through a design, creating a visual journey from one element to another.

### Common Eye-Tracking Patterns

**Z-Pattern:**
- Eye moves: top-left → top-right → diagonal down → bottom-left → bottom-right
- Best for: landing pages, simple layouts

**F-Pattern:**
- Eye scans horizontally across top, then down left side
- Best for: text-heavy pages, blogs, articles

**Layer Cake Pattern:**
- Eye scans headings, skips body text
- Best for: scannable content with clear sections

**How to apply:**
- Place important information along natural eye paths
- Use visual cues (arrows, lines) to direct attention
- Position CTAs where eyes naturally land

---

## 11. Emphasis

**What it is:** Highlighting the main focal point of your design to draw viewer attention.

**Why it matters:** Ensures viewers grasp your message quickly by drawing attention to the most important part.

**How to apply:**
Use other principles to create emphasis:
- **Color:** Bright accent on neutral background
- **Contrast:** Dark element on light area
- **White space:** Isolate important element
- **Proportion:** Make focal point larger
- **Position:** Place at natural focal points

---

## 12. Proximity

**What it is:** How objects and design elements are placed together to show their relationship.

**The rule:**
- **Close together** = Related, connected
- **Far apart** = Unrelated, separate

**Example:** Navigation buttons ("Home", "About", "Contact") are placed close together, showing their relationship and making them easier to find.

**How to apply:**
- Group related elements together
- Use white space to separate unrelated groups
- Create clear visual groupings
- Maintain consistent spacing within groups

---

## 13. Unity

**What it is:** The principle that ties all design rules together to ensure the design feels harmonious and cohesive.

**When achieved:** All elements flow seamlessly to form a unified composition.

**How to apply:**
- Use consistent colors, fonts, and shapes
- Apply proximity to organize information
- Use grid system for consistent spacing and alignment
- Create rhythm through repetition
- Ensure all elements serve the overall message
